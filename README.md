# calculator
Basic HTML calculator. This is the final project in the sereies of assignemnts from TOP's foundations course. As such, I would be putting in actual effort into this program as a visualisation of all the skill that I have gained over the course of the past week.

Update August 31 4:21 AM: I have now finished this project and safe to say it is an absolute disaster. Numbers being parsed in directly from the display meant that a * b != b * a. I will try to fix it one last time.
