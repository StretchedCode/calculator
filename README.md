# calculator
Basic HTML calculator. This is the final project in the series of assignemnts from TOP's foundations course. As such, I would be putting in actual effort into this program as a visualisation of all the skill that I have gained over the course of the past week.

Update August 31 4:21 AM: I have now finished this project and safe to say it is an absolute disaster. Numbers being parsed in directly from the display meant that a * b != b * a. I will try to fix it one last time.

Final update august 31 4:59 AM: Phew, what a ride this project has been in the past hour. I have been truly humbled in terms of programming and have been left absolutely bewildered by this project and JavaScript. It shows that I have a lot left to learn. Despite all of the hardships, it was interesting programming this calculator, even if it has some quirks. Pressing the '=' button in between each operation is a MUST in order to ensure proper functionality of the program.

I would rate this program a 8/10 in terms of meeting TOP's requirements. Not much work was put in aeshtetically and 100% of the functionality requirements were not met.
